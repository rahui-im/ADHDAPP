## ✅ P0-001: Navigation System Implementation

### Required vs Implemented

| Requirement | Status | Implementation | Notes |
|-------------|--------|----------------|-------|
| Install React Router v6 | ✅ | `react-router-dom@7.8.2` installed | Newer version than spec |
| Create Router Configuration | ⚠️ | `src/router/AppRouter.tsx` exists | Uses Routes/Route pattern instead of createBrowserRouter |
| Update App.tsx | ✅ | BrowserRouter integrated | Properly wrapped |
| Update Layout Component | ✅ | Uses Outlet and NavLink | Correctly implemented |
| Create 404 Page | ❌ | Not created | Using Navigate redirect instead |
| Add Navigation Hooks | ❌ | Not created | `useNavigation.ts` missing |
| Lazy Loading | ✅ | All pages lazy loaded | Good performance optimization |
| Loading States | ✅ | Suspense with Loading component | Proper fallback |

### Implementation Differences:
1. **Router Pattern**: Used `<Routes>` pattern instead of `createBrowserRouter` (both valid)
2. **404 Handling**: Using `<Navigate to="/dashboard">` instead of dedicated 404 page
3. **Path Structure**: All paths are relative (no leading `/` in child routes) - correct
4. **Navigation Items**: Using emoji icons instead of Heroicons

### Definition of Done Checklist:
- [x] All navigation menu items work
- [x] Direct URL access functional for all routes
- [x] Browser navigation (back/forward) works
- [x] 404 handling (redirects to dashboard)
- [x] No console errors during navigation
